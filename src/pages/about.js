          So, who’s behind all this?

        <p>
          Hey there 👋 I’m <strong>David</strong> — your English coach, convo partner,
          and buzzword translator. I created this program for people who are already awesome
          at what they do… but just want to feel a little more confident chatting, emailing, or
          presenting in English at work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve worked with professionals from tech, design, finance, marketing — you name it.
          Whether you're joining Zoom calls with international teams, replying in Slack threads,
          or just want to sound a little more natural in English, I’ve got your back.
        </p>

        <p>
          This coaching isn’t stuffy. It’s not grammar drills or exam prep. It’s just real-world
          conversations, practice with the lingo people actually use, and getting comfy with
          business small talk, emails, DMs, and those *“got a sec?”* moments.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl text-peach font-semibold mt-8">Why I do this 💬</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve seen smart, capable professionals stay quiet in meetings just because they were
          unsure about their English. That shouldn’t happen. You deserve to speak up, crack
          a joke, ask questions — and just be yourself, in English.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I created <strong>Biz English with Friends</strong> to make that easier, more fun,
          and honestly, a bit warmer. It’s not a classroom — it’s a conversation. You in?
